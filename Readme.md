# Advanced Chess Analysis & Training Suite

This project is a Python-based chess analysis and training suite built with Tkinter and powered by the [**searchless-chess from deep mind**](https://github.com/google-deepmind/searchless_chess) library‚Äîa transformer-based neural network engine that evaluates chess positions purely through pattern recognition, without relying on brute-force search.

Unlike traditional chess engines that evaluate millions of positions per second, **searchless-chess** makes moves based solely on deep positional understanding, just like a human master. This eliminates the usual frustration or excuse of competing against a machine‚Äôs calculation speed, keeping training realistic, fair, and insightful.

The suite utilizes two distinct engines‚Äî**9M** and **136M**‚Äîto deliver balanced and actionable feedback:

* **9M engine:** Elo \~2050, better than 90% of players on lichess. Its analysis focuses on practical, achievable moves suitable for ambitious hobbyists and club players.
* **136M engine:** Elo \~2700 (senior master, roughly 2450 USCF). Provides world-class insights and challenging analyses, perfect for players aspiring to advanced mastery.

With this dual-engine approach, you receive meaningful, human-like training and advice‚Äînot just ‚Äúperfect‚Äù moves you have no realistic chance of finding.

## Applications

### üéØ PGN Analyzer (`main_pgn_analyzer_gui.py`)
Deep, move-by-move analysis of a complete game from PGN. Uses both 9M and 136M engines with color-coded hints and evaluation symbols (!, ??, etc.).

### üß† Blunder Trainer (`main_blunder_trainer_gui.py`)
Trains users on previously made blunders. Includes a progress tracker and filters solved puzzles.

### ‚ôüÔ∏è Play vs. Engine (`play_against_engine.py`)
Play a full Chess960 game against the 9M engine. Asymmetric random starting positions included.

### üõ†Ô∏è Blunder Scanner (`blunder_scanner.py`)
Command-line tool that detects blunders from PGN files and creates a `blunders_report.json` used by the Blunder Trainer.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/simsim314/Searchless-Chess-Trainer.git
cd searchless-chess/checkpoints
bash download.sh
cd ..
cd ..

python blunder_scanner.py my_games.pgn --player YourLichessUsername --output_json blunders_report.json
```

### 2. Run the PGN Analyzer

```bash
python main_pgn_analyzer_gui.py
```

### 3. Run the Blunder Trainer

```bash
python main_blunder_trainer_gui.py
```

### 4. Play Against the Engine

```bash
python play_against_engine.py
```
